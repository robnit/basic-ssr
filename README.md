# Basic SSR attempt

### Problem
When people talk about server side rendering, I knowingly nod despite having very little firsthand experience. I think I know what it means, but haven't built it from the ground up.


### Solution
Create a basic implementation of SSR. Start at the simplest possible use case (single page with basic react state). Add complexity (routing logic etc).
